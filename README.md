# oxygenxml.emf.support
Oxygen XML Editor does not render by default EMF images. 

This plugin allow it to render EMF images in Author mode but you need to install 
additional libraries in order to make it work.
You need to download a binary libraries distribution from:

http://java.freehep.org/vectorgraphics/index.html

for example download the ZIP file:

ftp://ftp.slac.stanford.edu/software/freehep/VectorGraphics/v2.1.1/vectorgraphics-2.1.1-bin.zip

unpack it and all the "*.jar" libraries from its "lib" folder should be moved to the plugin's "lib" folder.
