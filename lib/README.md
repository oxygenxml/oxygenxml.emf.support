You need to download a binary libraries distribution from:

http://java.freehep.org/vectorgraphics/index.html

for example download the ZIP file:

ftp://ftp.slac.stanford.edu/software/freehep/VectorGraphics/v2.1.1/vectorgraphics-2.1.1-bin.zip

unpack it and all the "*.jar" libraries from its "lib" folder should be moved to this "lib" folder.
